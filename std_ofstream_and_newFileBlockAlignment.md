The std::ofstream is an object from the C++ Standard Library that represents an output file stream used to create files and write data to them. The std::ofstream stands for "output file stream" and is part of the C++ input/output library <fstream>, which also includes std::ifstream (input file stream) for reading files and std::fstream for both reading and writing.

Mode Flags
When opening a file, you can specify various mode flags:

std::ios::out: Default mode for std::ofstream, open for writing.
std::ios::app: Append to the file instead of overwriting it.
std::ios::binary: Open in binary mode instead of text mode.
Example of opening a file in append and binary mode:

std::ofstream writer("example.bin", std::ios::app | std::ios::binary);

# new file block alignment

File Opening:

The file is opened with writer.open(filename, std::ios::binary);. If the file already exists, it will be truncated to zero length because the default behavior of std::ofstream when opened in std::ios::binary mode without explicitly specifying std::ios::app is to discard the contents. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
From this point, any writes to the file will start at the beginning, effectively at the start of the first sector or page managed by the file system.

Assuming that the initial file pointer is at the beginning of a new file, and given that the file was opened in binary mode, the first write operation from the cache would align with the beginning of a sector or page on the disk. This is because most operating systems and file systems align the start of new files with the beginning of a new disk sector or page for efficiency.

Writes that begin at the start of a new file are naturally aligned with the start of sectors/pages unless offset by previous operations or specific file system configurations.

The alignment of the first write operation with the beginning of a sector or page on the disk is primarily dictated by the underlying file system and operating system's disk management strategies. Here's a more detailed explanation of why this alignment typically occurs:

# File System and Disk Block Allocation
File Creation:

When a new file is created, the file system allocates space for it on the disk. This allocation is typically done in terms of "blocks" or "clusters," depending on the file system terminology. These blocks are composed of one or more "sectors," which are the smallest physical storage units on a disk.

Block Alignment:

Most modern file systems align the start of a new file with the beginning of a block. This is not just a coincidence but a designed feature:
Performance: Disk read and write operations are fastest when the data is aligned with the physical sectors. Misaligned accesses, where a read or write operation spans multiple sectors, can significantly degrade performance because they may require additional disk rotations to access the misaligned data.
Efficiency: Aligning writes with the physical sectors minimizes the need for read-modify-write cycles, where the disk needs to read and modify partial sectors before writing them back. This is particularly important for write operations.

The alignment of the first write operation with the beginning of a sector or page on the disk is primarily dictated by the underlying file system and operating system's disk management strategies. Here's a more detailed explanation of why this alignment typically occurs:
