The terms "pointer" and "address of a variable" are closely related but have distinct meanings in C++ programming.

### Address of a Variable
The address of a variable refers to the memory location where the variable's value is stored. In C++, you can obtain the address of a variable using the address-of operator (`&`).

**Example:**
```cpp
int var = 10;
int* ptr = &var;  // &var gives the address of the variable var
```
In this example:
- `var` is a variable of type `int`.
- `&var` is the address of the variable `var`.
- `ptr` is a pointer that holds the address of `var`.

### Pointer
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers can be used to access and manipulate the value stored at the memory address they point to. Pointers themselves have addresses and can point to other pointers.

**Example:**
```cpp
int var = 10;
int* ptr = &var;  // ptr is a pointer to an integer

*ptr = 20;  // Modify the value of var through the pointer

int** double_ptr = &ptr;  // double_ptr is a pointer to a pointer to an integer
```
In this example:
- `ptr` is a pointer to an integer (`int*`) and stores the address of `var`.
- `*ptr` dereferences the pointer `ptr` to access or modify the value of `var`.
- `double_ptr` is a pointer to a pointer to an integer (`int**`), storing the address of `ptr`.

### Key Differences

1. **Nature:**
   - **Address of a Variable:** The actual memory location of a variable.
   - **Pointer:** A variable that holds the memory address of another variable.

2. **Usage:**
   - **Address of a Variable:** Used with the address-of operator (`&`) to obtain the memory address.
   - **Pointer:** Used to store addresses, perform pointer arithmetic, and dereference to access the value stored at the address.

3. **Syntax:**
   - **Address of a Variable:** Obtained using the address-of operator (`&`).
   - **Pointer:** Defined with an asterisk (`*`) in its type declaration and can be dereferenced using the asterisk.

**Example Illustrating Both Concepts:**

```cpp
int var = 10;    // Declare an integer variable
int* ptr;        // Declare a pointer to an integer

ptr = &var;      // Assign the address of var to ptr

// Now, ptr holds the address of var, and we can access var through ptr
std::cout << "Address of var: " << &var << std::endl;
std::cout << "Value stored in ptr: " << ptr << std::endl;
std::cout << "Value of var via ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl;
```
In this code:
- `&var` is the address of the variable `var`.
- `ptr` is a pointer that stores the address of `var`.
- `*ptr` dereferences `ptr` to access the value of `var`.

### Summary
- The **address of a variable** is its memory location, obtained using `&`.
- A **pointer** is a variable that holds the address of another variable and can be dereferenced using `*` to access or modify the value at that address.
