size_t is an unsigned integer data type defined in the C and C++ standard libraries. It is used to represent the size of objects in bytes and is the type returned by the sizeof operator.

Typical Usage of size_t
Array Indexing and Loop Counters:

size_t is often used for array indexing and loop counters to ensure compatibility with the sizes of arrays and other containers.
Memory Management Functions:

Functions like malloc and calloc use size_t for their size parameters.
Standard Library Containers:

Many standard library containers (e.g., std::vector, std::string) use size_t for their size and capacity types.
