### Modifying a Set During Iteration

When you iterate over a container like a set and modify it (e.g., by adding or removing elements), you may invalidate iterators and cause undefined behavior. This is because the underlying data structure can change in ways that the iterator does not expect, leading to potential issues like:

1. **Invalidated Iterators**: Adding or removing elements might cause the container to resize or rehash, invalidating the iterators.
2. **Unexpected Results**: The modifications can lead to missing elements or processing elements multiple times.

In your original code, you are iterating over `nbrs_set` and inserting new neighbors into the same set:

```cpp
for (const auto& n : nbrs_set) {
    if (visited_nbrs_set.insert(n).second) {
        auto newNbrs = _graph_store->get_neighbours(n);
        for (const auto& new_nbr : newNbrs) {
            nbrs_set.insert(new_nbr);  // Modification during iteration
        }
    }
}
```

### Safe Approach: Copying Current Neighbors

To avoid the pitfalls of modifying a container during iteration, you can use a temporary container to collect the modifications and then apply them after the iteration is complete. This ensures that the original container remains unchanged during the iteration, preventing iterator invalidation and ensuring correct behavior.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Use a Temporary Set**: Create a temporary set `new_nbrs_set` to collect new neighbors.
2. **Collect New Neighbors**: During the iteration, insert new neighbors into `new_nbrs_set` instead of directly into `nbrs_set`.
3. **Update the Original Set**: After the iteration over `nbrs_set` is complete, move the contents of `new_nbrs_set` into `nbrs_set` for the next hop.

### Revised Code

Here's how this approach is implemented in the revised code:

```cpp
int hops = 3;
// Make a set of neighbors
tsl::robin_set<uint32_t> nbrs_set;
tsl::robin_set<uint32_t> visited_nbrs_set;

// Initialize with the current node
nbrs_set.insert(currNode);

for (int hop = 0; hop < hops; ++hop) {
    tsl::robin_set<uint32_t> new_nbrs_set;  // Temporary set for new neighbors
    
    for (const auto& n : nbrs_set) {
        // If the node is successfully inserted into visited set, it means it was not visited before
        if (visited_nbrs_set.insert(n).second) {
            // Get the neighbors of the node
            auto newNbrs = _graph_store->get_neighbours(n);
            
            // Insert new neighbors into the temporary set
            for (const auto& new_nbr : newNbrs) {
                new_nbrs_set.insert(new_nbr);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Update the neighbors set for the next hop
    nbrs_set = std::move(new_nbrs_set);  // Efficiently move the temporary set
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach

1. **Safety**: Avoids undefined behavior by not modifying the set being iterated.
2. **Clarity**: Makes the code more understandable by clearly separating the collection and application of new neighbors.
3. **Efficiency**: Using `std::move` ensures efficient transfer of elements between sets.

By using this method, you ensure that your code adheres to safe and predictable practices, preventing potential runtime errors and making it easier to maintain and understand.
