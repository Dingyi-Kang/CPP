Original codes:

      template <typename T> class ScratchStoreManager
      {
        public:
          ScratchStoreManager(ConcurrentQueue<T *> &query_scratch) : _scratch_pool(query_scratch)
          {
              _scratch = query_scratch.pop();
              while (_scratch == nullptr)
              {
                  query_scratch.wait_for_push_notify();
                  _scratch = query_scratch.pop();
              }
          }
          T *scratch_space()
          {
              return _scratch;
          }
      
          ~ScratchStoreManager()
          {
              _scratch->clear();
              _scratch_pool.push(_scratch);
              _scratch_pool.push_notify_all();
          }
      
          void destroy()
          {
              while (!_scratch_pool.empty())
              {
                  auto scratch = _scratch_pool.pop();
                  while (scratch == nullptr)
                  {
                      _scratch_pool.wait_for_push_notify();
                      scratch = _scratch_pool.pop();
                  }
                  delete scratch;
              }
          }
      
        private:
          T *_scratch;
          ConcurrentQueue<T *> &_scratch_pool;
          ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
          ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
      };

Let's break down the `ScratchStoreManager` class template to understand its fields and functions. This class is designed to manage scratch space efficiently, using a concurrent queue to handle multiple threads' scratch space needs.

### Class Template Definition

```cpp
template <typename T> class ScratchStoreManager
{
  public:
    // Constructor
    ScratchStoreManager(ConcurrentQueue<T *> &query_scratch);

    // Function to get the current scratch space
    T *scratch_space();

    // Destructor
    ~ScratchStoreManager();

    // Function to destroy the scratch space
    void destroy();

  private:
    // Pointer to the scratch space currently being managed
    T *_scratch;

    // Reference to the concurrent queue of scratch spaces
    ConcurrentQueue<T *> &_scratch_pool;

    // Disable copy constructor
    ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);

    // Disable copy assignment operator
    ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
};
```

### Fields

1. **T *_scratch:**
   - **Type:** `T *` (pointer to type `T`).
   - **Purpose:** Holds the pointer to the scratch space currently being managed. This scratch space is allocated and reused by the manager.
   - **Initialization:** This pointer is set in the constructor by popping an element from the concurrent queue.

2. **ConcurrentQueue<T *> &_scratch_pool:**
   - **Type:** `ConcurrentQueue<T *> &` (reference to a concurrent queue of pointers to type `T`).
   - **Purpose:** Represents a pool of scratch spaces. The queue is used to manage and provide scratch spaces to different threads in a thread-safe manner.
   - **Initialization:** This reference is initialized in the constructor with the provided `query_scratch` parameter.

### Constructor

```cpp
ScratchStoreManager(ConcurrentQueue<T *> &query_scratch) : _scratch_pool(query_scratch)
{
    _scratch = query_scratch.pop();
    while (_scratch == nullptr)
    {
        query_scratch.wait_for_push_notify();
        _scratch = query_scratch.pop();
    }
}
```
- **Purpose:** Initializes the `ScratchStoreManager` by acquiring a scratch space from the `query_scratch` pool.
- **Process:**
  - The constructor attempts to pop a scratch space from the concurrent queue.
  - If no scratch space is available (`_scratch == nullptr`), it waits for a notification that a scratch space has been pushed into the queue and retries.

### Member Functions

1. **T *scratch_space()**
   ```cpp
   T *scratch_space()
   {
       return _scratch;
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Returns the pointer to the currently managed scratch space.
   - **Usage:** This function provides access to the scratch space for operations.

2. **~ScratchStoreManager()**
   ```cpp
   ~ScratchStoreManager()
   {
       _scratch->clear();
       _scratch_pool.push(_scratch);
       _scratch_pool.push_notify_all();
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Destructor that cleans up the scratch space.
   - **Process:**
     - Calls the `clear` method on the scratch space to reset its state.
     - Pushes the scratch space back into the concurrent queue for reuse.
     - Notifies all waiting threads that a new scratch space is available.

3. **void destroy()**
   ```cpp
   void destroy()
   {
       while (!_scratch_pool.empty())
       {
           auto scratch = _scratch_pool.pop();
           while (scratch == nullptr)
           {
               _scratch_pool.wait_for_push_notify();
               scratch = _scratch_pool.pop();
           }
           delete scratch;
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Destroys all scratch spaces in the concurrent queue.
   - **Process:**
     - Continuously pops scratch spaces from the queue.
     - Waits for a scratch space to become available if the queue is empty.
     - Deletes each scratch space.

### Private Section

1. **Copy Constructor (Deleted)**
   ```cpp
   ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Prevents copying of the `ScratchStoreManager` instance.
   - **Effect:** Declaring the copy constructor private without providing an implementation disables the ability to copy an instance of `ScratchStoreManager`.

2. **Copy Assignment Operator (Deleted)**
   ```cpp
   ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
   ```
   - **Purpose:** Prevents assignment of the `ScratchStoreManager` instance.
   - **Effect:** Declaring the copy assignment operator private without providing an implementation disables the ability to assign one instance of `ScratchStoreManager` to another.

### Summary

The `ScratchStoreManager` class template is designed to manage temporary scratch spaces efficiently, ensuring they are reused across multiple threads. It uses a concurrent queue to handle the allocation and deallocation of scratch spaces in a thread-safe manner. The key fields and functions are:

- **Fields:**
  - `_scratch`: Holds the current scratch space.
  - `_scratch_pool`: Reference to the pool of scratch spaces.

- **Functions:**
  - `ScratchStoreManager(ConcurrentQueue<T *> &query_scratch)`: Initializes the manager by acquiring a scratch space.
  - `T *scratch_space()`: Returns the current scratch space.
  - `~ScratchStoreManager()`: Clears and returns the scratch space to the pool upon destruction.
  - `void destroy()`: Destroys all scratch spaces in the pool.

By ensuring that scratch spaces are properly managed and reused, this class helps optimize resource usage and maintain thread safety.

# Why prohibit Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator

Certainly! Let's delve into why and how the declarations of the copy constructor and copy assignment operator in the `ScratchStoreManager` class template disable copying and assignment.

### Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator

In C++, the copy constructor and copy assignment operator are special member functions that handle the copying of objects. By default, the compiler provides implicit definitions for these functions, allowing objects to be copied and assigned.

### Declaring Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator Private

When you declare these functions as private and do not provide implementations, it prevents other parts of the program from copying or assigning objects of the class. This is a common idiom in C++ to make a class non-copyable.

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Copy Constructor:**

   ```cpp
   ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
   ```

   - **Purpose:** The copy constructor is responsible for creating a new object as a copy of an existing object. It is called when an object is initialized from another object of the same type.
   - **Private Declaration:** By declaring the copy constructor private, you restrict access to it. Since no implementation is provided, any attempt to copy an object of this class type will result in a compile-time error if the copy constructor is called from outside the class.

2. **Copy Assignment Operator:**

   ```cpp
   ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
   ```

   - **Purpose:** The copy assignment operator is responsible for assigning the values from one existing object to another existing object of the same type. It is called when an assignment is made between objects of the same type.
   - **Private Declaration:** By declaring the copy assignment operator private, you restrict access to it. Since no implementation is provided, any attempt to assign one object of this class type to another will result in a compile-time error if the copy assignment operator is called from outside the class.

### Why Disable Copying and Assignment?

In the context of `ScratchStoreManager`, copying and assignment might be undesirable due to the following reasons:

1. **Resource Management:**
   - The class manages resources like pointers to scratch spaces. Copying these pointers directly could lead to issues like double deletions, resource leaks, or corruption since multiple instances would think they own the same resource.

2. **Concurrent Access:**
   - The class interacts with a concurrent queue (`ConcurrentQueue<T *> &`). Copying or assigning instances could complicate the management of this queue and lead to synchronization issues or race conditions.

3. **Unique Ownership:**
   - The class likely maintains unique ownership of the scratch space it manages. Allowing copies would break this ownership model and lead to undefined behavior.

### Example of Compilation Error

If an attempt is made to copy or assign an instance of `ScratchStoreManager`, the compiler will generate an error. For example:

```cpp
ScratchStoreManager<int> manager1(someQueue);
ScratchStoreManager<int> manager2 = manager1;  // Error: Copy constructor is private
ScratchStoreManager<int> manager3(someQueue);
manager3 = manager1;  // Error: Copy assignment operator is private
```

### Alternative Modern Approach (C++11 and Beyond)

In modern C++ (C++11 and beyond), you can use the `delete` keyword to explicitly disable these operations, making the intent more clear:

```cpp
ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &) = delete;
ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &) = delete;
```

This explicitly tells the compiler to disable the copy constructor and copy assignment operator, making the intent clear and resulting in a more descriptive error message if copying or assignment is attempted.

### Summary

By declaring the copy constructor and copy assignment operator private and not providing implementations, `ScratchStoreManager` effectively disables copying and assignment. This is done to prevent issues related to resource management, concurrent access, and unique ownership. In modern C++, the `delete` keyword provides a clearer way to achieve the same effect.

# How they prevent Copy Constructor and Copy Assignment Operator

Sure! Let's break down the grammar and explain the syntax of these two lines of code in detail:

### Code Line 1:
```cpp
ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
```

### Code Line 2:
```cpp
ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
```

## Code Line 1: Copy Constructor Declaration

```cpp
ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
```

### Explanation

This line declares a copy constructor for the `ScratchStoreManager` class template. The copy constructor is responsible for creating a new object as a copy of an existing object.

### Grammar Breakdown

- **`ScratchStoreManager`**:
  - This is the name of the class template. It specifies that the following member function is part of the `ScratchStoreManager` class.

- **`const ScratchStoreManager<T> &`**:
  - **`const`**: This keyword indicates that the parameter is a constant. The object passed to the copy constructor will not be modified.
  - **`ScratchStoreManager<T>`**: This specifies the type of the parameter, which is an instance of the `ScratchStoreManager` class template with template parameter `T`.
  - **`&`**: This indicates that the parameter is passed by reference. Passing by reference avoids making a copy of the object, which is more efficient.

- **`;`**:
  - The semicolon at the end of the line indicates that this is a declaration. There is no definition (i.e., no implementation code) provided here.

### Purpose

- **Disabling Copy Constructor**:
  - By declaring the copy constructor as private (in the full class definition, which is not shown here), the class prevents other parts of the code from copying instances of `ScratchStoreManager`. This helps to manage resources and avoid issues like double-deletion.

## Code Line 2: Copy Assignment Operator Declaration

```cpp
ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
```

### Explanation

This line declares the copy assignment operator for the `ScratchStoreManager` class template. The copy assignment operator is responsible for assigning the values from one existing object to another existing object of the same type.

### Grammar Breakdown

- **`ScratchStoreManager &`**:
  - This indicates the return type of the copy assignment operator. It returns a reference to the object that the values were assigned to (typically `*this`).

- **`operator=`**:
  - This is the name of the function. In C++, `operator=` is a special function name that indicates the assignment operator.

- **`const ScratchStoreManager<T> &`**:
  - **`const`**: Indicates that the parameter is a constant. The object passed to the assignment operator will not be modified.
  - **`ScratchStoreManager<T>`**: Specifies the type of the parameter, which is an instance of the `ScratchStoreManager` class template with template parameter `T`.
  - **`&`**: Indicates that the parameter is passed by reference to avoid making a copy of the object.

- **`;`**:
  - The semicolon at the end of the line indicates that this is a declaration. There is no definition (i.e., no implementation code) provided here.

### Purpose

- **Disabling Copy Assignment Operator**:
  - By declaring the copy assignment operator as private (in the full class definition, which is not shown here), the class prevents other parts of the code from assigning instances of `ScratchStoreManager`. This helps to manage resources and avoid issues like double-deletion.

### Context

In a typical class definition, these declarations would look like this:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class ScratchStoreManager {
public:
    // Other member functions...

private:
    // Copy constructor
    ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);

    // Copy assignment operator
    ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);
};
```

### Modern C++ (C++11 and Beyond)

In C++11 and later, a more modern and clear way to disable the copy constructor and copy assignment operator is to use the `delete` keyword:

```cpp
template <typename T>
class ScratchStoreManager {
public:
    // Other member functions...

    // Disable copy constructor
    ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &) = delete;

    // Disable copy assignment operator
    ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &) = delete;
};
```

This approach makes the intent explicit and produces a clearer error message if copying or assignment is attempted.

### Summary

- **Copy Constructor Declaration**:
  - `ScratchStoreManager(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);`
  - Declares a copy constructor that takes a constant reference to another `ScratchStoreManager` object.
  - Typically used to prevent copying by making it private and not providing an implementation.

- **Copy Assignment Operator Declaration**:
  - `ScratchStoreManager &operator=(const ScratchStoreManager<T> &);`
  - Declares a copy assignment operator that takes a constant reference to another `ScratchStoreManager` object.
  - Typically used to prevent assignment by making it private and not providing an implementation.
